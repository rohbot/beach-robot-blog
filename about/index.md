Beach Bot is a out-of-hours project being undertaken by Andrew and Rohan. 

The problem: there's a lot of litter in our oceans on on our beaches. We are focussing on the beach stuff to see if we can do something about it. There's waaaaayyyyy too much litter for a few dedicated people to pick up let alone the hudreds of volunteers around the world. We need another solution...

##Let's build a Beach Cleaning Robot!!!

This will be where we blog our progress as we slowly progress towards our goals as we both have full-time jobs and Andrew is doing a part time Masters as well!

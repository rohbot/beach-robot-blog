Tried charging the batteries today with the fancy new charger. First time using it and I think I set everything up right including the cables include the balance cables. When I hit the button to start charging it came up with a balance cable error. Need to investigate why. No luck troubleshooting yesterday.

Hoping this was just first-time user error and not that the batteries are dead from being left discharged for too long.

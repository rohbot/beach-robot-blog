Crap. I (Andrew) went down to the beach to make up for Sunday's power debacle only to have another fiasco. As part of messing around fixing the GPS a couple of days ago I turned off the camera service. And did not rememeber to turn it back on :(  So I got a great GPS track...

But no pictures (even though I was pressing the button!) but didn't find out until I got home and downloaded the data. What a pain. 

Clearly need a better solution to the services and when they fail on the next version.

Rohan worked on the website last night and now it's up.

Uber simple and quick! Now all I have to do is make it look a little prettier :)

In other progress today I did some more work on the Trello pushing some cards around and creating Beach Bot V4 board as well. As we get ideas we can capture them there...

To stop some scope creep decided to push the "Save photo to cloud" feature to the Version 4.

Finished the first part of the UI. It's a bit rough around the edges but as someone once said "If your first MVP is pretty then you've spent too much time on it". :)

Realised that we may be able to remove some of the services and instead use direct call from the flask server to do things like shutdown and so on. Will make the build simplier and maybe easier to debug.

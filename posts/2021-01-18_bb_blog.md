Start coding up the UI design in HTML. This will take a few days as I don't have a lot of time to work on it at the moment. 

Picked up the L298N dual motor module for the drive controllers. Holding off on other parts for the time being until the Rohan has a chance to go thorugh his junk box and see what else he might have already.

Asked the Raspberry Pi club members if anyone had a LiPo charger for the radio controlled car without any luck so far. Though my brother mentioned he might have one. So a little progress today.

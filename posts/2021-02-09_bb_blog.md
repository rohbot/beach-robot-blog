With redis getting set up yesterday and running it was time to start working on getting the UI to receive data having to trigger a refresh of the page or an api call. 

I normally work on the project first thing in the morning and having an medical appointment took out most of my time. I did get the websocket libraries into the HTML page and updated the Flask server to be a <code>socket.io()</code>. The Pi was happily serving up the content of the web page but the websocket was throwing a error every few seconds as it tried to connect.

Part II tomorrow!

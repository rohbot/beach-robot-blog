Started plumbing the new interface by replacing the shutdown service with Flask @route to do the shutdown via python code. After a few false starts it now working. Now in the UI, hitting the shutdown button triggers the shutdown confirm screen and OK triggers the shutdown code.

Well almost. The script is writing "Shutdown requested" to a file rather than actually shutting the Pi down as it would be a pain to wait for it to reboot each time :)

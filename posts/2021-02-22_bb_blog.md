Sometimes you just need a little break from a project to be able to clear your head and then come back to it. Though I only had 30 minutes to work on the project today I did get the forEach problem fixed and within a few minutes had the code working. Now you can pass JSON of any length and as long as the id tags in the HTML and the key of the JSON match then the script will update the page.

So next is the GPS and the M6050 sensors and all the programming for this stage is pretty much done. Will need to bring across the service scripts from V2 which aren't in github. Not having them under version control is not good practice and something I should probably fix...

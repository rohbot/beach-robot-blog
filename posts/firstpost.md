Rohan worked on the website last night and now it's up.

Uber simple and quick! Andew now has it on his todo to make it look a little prettier :)

In other progress today Andrew did some more work on the Trello pushing some cards around and creating 
Beach Bot V4 board as well. 

Decided to push the "Save photo to cloud" card to the V4 board. As we get ideas we can capture them there...

Struggling to find time in last few days to work on project. Hardware did not arrive before weekend and High Altitude Balloon work nearing deadline for tomorrow.

Did however get a few things done. Copied the GPS and m6050 service scripts across to the Pi. Decided that for file names I should use hypens ("-") instead of underscores ("_") in file names as that seems to be what Raspbarian OS uses consistently. Service file renamed to bring them in line with this convention.

Likewise I consolidated the .service files into the <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> directory as this seemed like the natural place for them.

Small progress - but better than nothing!

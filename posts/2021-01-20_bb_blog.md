Rohan started work on streaming the video to a web page from a Pi and was successful. He also added a take photo button. Here's some of the result from his testing.

We need to decide if we are going to run on a full Pi setup or something smaller like a Pi Zero. Will have a smaller size but not sure we'll have all the compute power we need. We'll have to try some tests and see how we go.

The charger I was looking to borrow unfortunately doesn't have the right connectors for the RC so it looks like it is purchase time.

Took the reflashed SD card and built up everything needed to get the application running on the Pi. Quite involved with 16 steps from empty card to working system. Not sure all will be able to be automated so it might be easier to just image the entire card. Though I have not done that in the past. Another learning oppurtunity!

Here is what the UI looks like now. The picture is pink as I'm using the Pi Noir IR camera instead of the regular Pi camera.  Flipping the image is on the to-do list as yesterday was all about just getting the video stream up and running!

Big step forward today.

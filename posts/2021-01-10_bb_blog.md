I went to do a field test / beach clean this morning and got there to find out no power cable. I took it off the bot when Rohan and I were looking at the V3 planning on Friday night and at some point it got seperated from the robot and now it's missing :(

Nothing to do but scrub field test. To make myself feel better just cleaned up litter I found on the street on the way home... 

Learning: take spare cables!  Actually one step further need a travel kit with key items - tape, cables, craft knife, possibly a multi-meter?

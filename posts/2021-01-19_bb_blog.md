Did some more work on the UI design in HTML. Slowly but surely it's coming together...

Still no luck on the LiPo charger for the RC car. 

There's a ML/AI meetup once a month and I mentioned what we were planning to build a classifier for beach rubbish. The main guy running it suggested pretty much the approach that I'm already doing which makes me think that there's a bug in my code somewhere. 

He also confirmed that I should try transfer learning rather than a 'roll-my-own' model and see how it goes as some parts of the model may identify features and then I just need to train a new 'top' to it.

He also suggested that to deal with the possibility of disappearing litter on rescale that I might want to try Faster R-CNN for object detection and location. As we are going to need to analyse real time video at some point I suspect this will almost inevitably lead to YOLO... but trying not to pre-define the path we will explore.

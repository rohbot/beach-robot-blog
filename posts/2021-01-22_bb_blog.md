Rohan and I met up to have a look at the radio controlled (RC) car and working out what electronics we'd need to change.

Rohan also gave the physical components of the car the once over looking at how well it was assembled. A few concerns were raised about the amount of play ('slop') in the steering which might make it problematical to steer. Then there were the motors. The H-Bridge board we bought is only rated for 4A and there is a suspicion that the motor used to drive the wheels may draw more than that... so the RC car might need to be replaced :(

On the upside the photo setup was streaming through a hotspot and the lag was not too bad. It will be quicker when we use a local connection as Rohan was sending it up to a cloud server and then accessing it via a browser on his phone.

We had a quick review of the UI and we are happy with how it is evolving. The UI is coming together slowly but surely. I have a Surface with a hand hold so you can use it as a tablet and walk with it while the bot travels along the ground. Demoed how that would work and seems to be AOK.

Inching forwards with the UI. Took one of Rohan's sample pictures from the stream yesterday and added into the UI as a mockup of the video. Then resized the 'take photo' button for the larger image.

Had a Melbourne Blender Society meetup this evening as well and met a few more people into 3D printing which may come in handy along the way.

Finished off the work yesterday with the creation of a new service to start the Flask server on startup. Then changed the shutdown code to actually shutdown the Pi rather than write to a file and it all works! Tested from the Surface and very happy the UI/server setup seems to be coming together. 

Need to hide all the UI content when shutdown is done so the UI doesn't give the impression that it is still connected. 

I suspect the redis piece might be a little harder... something for the weekend!

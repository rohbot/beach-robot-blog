Got the first popup working in the UI. This is to confirm that you really want to shutdown when you hit the shutdown button. At this stage it's only the HTML/CSS presentation I'm working on though it did involve a little bit of Javascript.

Once the presentation layer is all rigged up then the next part is integrating it with the flask server on the Pi. That will be cool if we can get that all working!

Messed around with the blog format and added some older posts. 

Also set up VNC on the Pi. If you know how to ssh into a Pi then VNC is even easier! At this stage we are running a full GUI version of Raspbian on the SD card. Thinking at a future state we'll cut it back to no GUI install and added that to the Version 5 backlog on Trello.

Nearly the weekend so started looking at the RC car to do a test on the sand. First need to charge the Lipo battery. I haven't used it in over a year so may have some problems there.

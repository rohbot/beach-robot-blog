Not a lot of action in the last few days as we both had other projects that we are working on take some focus. One was a high altitude balloon hunt in which we were successful in recovering the radiosonde. It was last seen in pieces on Rohan's desk.

There were a few developments yesterday. Rohan has got the camera set up working on a Pi Zero so we can continue to experiment with a smaller form factor for the electronics. Less weight is better though we do need to keep in mind that if the robot is too light it may get flipped by the wind.

I received the charger yesterday and are working through what needs to happen. With the amount of warning stickers plastered over every port I get the idea that it is not as simple as plugging the unit into the wall and then the battery into the charger :)

All a good learning opportunity. Speaking of which - next time I order something that uses mains power need to remember to check which plug it comes with. I accidentally ordered the United States version and so I'm going to need to use an adaptor until I can find an Australia cable which I probably have in storage.

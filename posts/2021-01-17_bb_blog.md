Managed to catch up with Rohan at the High Altitude Balloon get together and we went over the UI Design. Some the other attendees showed us examples of other interfaces and mentioned using blink and pygame in their own projects in the past. At this stage we are going to stick with our setup and see what happens.

We agreed to remove the emergency button from the UI mitigating the risk of hitting it accidentaly. Will replace with a physical switch to emergency stop the BeachBot. I was thinking something like a deadman hand switch like the ones you see in films - though I might be getting a bit carried away there. 

Need to add a cancel to the photo/classifier parts so you can cancel a photo if the BeachBot needs repoistiong to get a good photo. Also need to add a confirm to the Shutdown button in case it is hit accidentally.

Agreed that we would use a microcontroller like an Arduino to drive the various robot parts and communicate with the Pi through some form of serial comms. Updated Trello to reflect the changes in the design.

Searched for the radio controlled car charger in storage without any luck. Have one last place left to check or it's purchase time.

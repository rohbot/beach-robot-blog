Between Masters study, work and High Altitude Balloon work deadlines made little progress this week but squeezed some time in Saturday to get a little more done. 

I copied the scripts for both the GPS log and m6050 log and renamed them for the new convention of hyphens instead of underscores. 

Updated the GPS log to capture entire NMEA string instead of just the latitude and longitude. The NMEA parsing code didn't go to waste as I reused it to fill the dict that is published via redis.

Added in the redis publishing code to both scripts but don't have the hardware set up to test quite yet as I looking to do one final clean with robot V2 before disassembly.

I did however turn on the I2C and serial port via GPIO in the Raspberry Pi preferences. I2C should be done but I think I'll need to some more configuration of the serial device to get the GPS working.

That's it - small amounts of progress. On the upside I got a notification that the hardware will be delivered this week! Once that arrives Rohan and I can build and then we can get out field testing again
